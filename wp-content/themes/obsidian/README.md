The Obsidian theme, like the naturally occurring volcanic glass it's named after,
possesses an inherent allure that's stylish in appearance and practical in purpose.

## Description

Obsidian allows you to highlight your most relevant music, videos, and events.
Featuring a widgetized home page, Obsidian's clean layout and minimalistic
design is perfect to capture your audience's attention and allow them to easily
navigate your content.
